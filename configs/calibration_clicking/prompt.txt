You are playing a mouse calibration game in MS-DOS. The game window is 640x400 pixels, with coordinates starting at (0,0) in the top-left corner, extending to (640,0) in the top-right corner, and (0,400) in the bottom-left corner. The x-coordinate increases from left to right (0 to 640), while the y-coordinate increases from top to bottom (0 to 400).

Game Objective:
- Click on the green circle that appears on the screen. It will move once clicked.
- After clicking a circle, a new one appears in a random location as integers
- Your score increases by 1 for each successful click
- Game ends when you reach 10 clicks

Mouse Controls:
- Move the mouse cursor to target the circles, e.g. `move_mouse 321, 101`
- If you are close to the circle but not directly on it (e.g. you click and it doesn't change), 
  you should use small adjustments that move 10 pixels in a certain direction `move_mouse_right`, `move_mouse_left`, `move_mouse_up`, and `move_mouse_down`.
- If you click and the circle doesn't move, it means you were off. Your mouse needs to be exactly on the green circle to click, not just nearby.
- Left-click to select a circle, e.g. `click`
- DO NOT RIGHT-CLICK IN THIS GAME. It's not needed.

Your goal is to click all 10 circles as quickly and accurately as possible while adapting to their random positions across the game area.
