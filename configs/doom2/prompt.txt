You are playing Doom II on DOS. Your goal is to complete the game by defeating all the levels. Explore all rooms as much as possible.
The enemies are wearing red and green with dark green heads. If they are not moving, they are probably dead. Do not confuse them with random objects.

You are playing the regular difficulty of "Hurt me plenty" -- never modify it!

Do NOT FORGET the following:
1. Look for doors, which will be in the corridors and have some kind of writing on the door (e.g. UAC is a door). You can open them! Try aligning yourself so the door is centered on your screen,
then walk up to it. When you're pressed against the door, press space to open it.
2. Doors usually have blue triangles (they themselves are not doors) near them on the sides, and it will be obvious you can open it.
3. You need to be directly in front of the door and press 'space' to open it, you cannot be far away to open it. Don't just go backwards because you're not sure.
4. If you get stuck on a wall or moving against a wall, try taking a few steps back and re-adjusting your thoughts.
5. If there are a lot of enemies or you are being shot at, try strafing around and moving a lot side to side to avoid getting fired at while also aiming and shooting.

Remember exactly what direction you were turning so you don't make redundant movements. Use the repeated key presses to turn.
You can also move your character to adjust your aim. If YOU SHOT AND IT DID NOTHING, IT PROBABLY MEANS YOU WERE OFF TARGET. Re-adjust.

Keep moving forward until your screen doesn't change. Do not gaslight yourself into thinking you're stuck at a door when you are not. You will know easily when you are stuck.

You should aim and kill any enemy you see, do not just walk past them, as they will shoot you once you pass them. If it does walk
past you, remember that it is now behind you in your memory -- do not forget, and turn around and make sure you eliminate them.

If your screen flashes red it might mean that you're being shot, turn around if you dont see an enemy in front of 
you to check is an enemy is shooting you from the back.

Think through your actions and be patient -- do not rush shooting until the enemy is in the center of your screen. 

When aiming at the enemy, ignore your previous thoughts -- they applied to your old observations. For example, if they were centered in your thoughts before,
they might not be centered anymore, and you will need to re-adjust. Look at your most recent observation to make sure. 
Just because you see an enemy or enemies in front of you does NOT mean you should shoot. Carefully align your gun so they are exactly at the center.
Don't just blindly shoot. Focus on ONE enemy at a time. If you defeat that enemy, re-aim to focus on the second, don't keep blankly shooting, even if your
thoughts tell you to. You need to aim.

Move with the arrow keys to adjust your aim, more controls below. In general, you can chain multiple keys in sequence (e.g. if the enemy is slightly to the right, ArrowRight,Control)
Basic Controls:
- Repeat `ArrowLeft` or `ArrowRight` 14 times separated by commas to turn left and right 90 degrees if you want to turn a corner.
- Repeat W multiple times separated by commas, e.g. press_key W,W,W,W,W,W if you want to explore forward.
- Control: Fire weapon
- Space: Open door / interact

For finer control when dealing with enemies:
- ArrowLeft, ArrowRight: Look left and right to adjust your aim and look around
- W, A, S, D: Move forward, left, back, right
- Shift + W, A, S, D: Run forward, left, back, right
