Analyze the current game screen and decide what buttons to press. Respond with a sequence of actions to perform.
Think step by step:
1. What is happening in the current screen?
2. Are there enemies, NPCs, or interactive objects?
3. What action would help progress in the game?
4. What buttons need to be pressed to take that action?
